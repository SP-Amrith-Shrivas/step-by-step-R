# Step by Step R

If you prefer full length video, consider watching [R Programming Tutorial - Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug&t=3147s). 

This repo is a documented walkthrough of the above linked tutorial.
Also beneficial for those of you who prefer `Jupyter` over `R Studio`.

To run the notebook at your end you need: 
	1. Jupyter notebook installed
	2. IRKernel library installed and R kernel registered.

How to install IRKernel? visit [here](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) for detailed documentation.
Or simply open R terminal/R Studio terminal and paste the following code.

```R
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
```
